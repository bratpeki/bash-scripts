## Requirements

### Adding linux-scripts to PATH

If you cloned the repository to `~/github/linux-scripts`, you should add the following line to your `.bashrc`:

```sh
PATH=$PATH:~/github/linux-scripts
```

Adding these scripts to ``$PATH`` is necessary, because many of them use ``which`` to find out where they are and access files in ``deps\``

### Additional binaries

This projects depends on the following binaries:

- [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/), used for any list in the repo, another alternative is [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [curl](https://curl.se/), used for accessing terminal-friendly web pages
- [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh), used by ``bgman`` for loading background images

## Thanks

The following scripts were made possible by:
