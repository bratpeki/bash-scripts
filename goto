# Description: Quickly access direcoties
#              The user has to define an EXPLORER variable (vifm, ranger, nnn, vim, dolphin ...)
#              Otherwise, "$EXPLORER" should just be replaced with some explorer of choice
# Example:     None provided, script uses graphical tool(s)

# "-type d" is not necessary if the explorer of choice doubles as an editor
# excluding paths can preferrably be done by using "!/-not -path "*word-in-your-path*""
findCommand="find $HOME -maxdepth 5 -type d"

echo "Getting directories..."
