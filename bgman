# Description: Manage background images using feh
#              This script is intended to be used on WM's, since most, if
#              not all, modern DE's have their own background image tools.
#              This one was made specifically for dwm.
#              $HOME/.fehbg is created after using bgman and loads as part of
#              my dwm's startup script

# Edit this location with the place you want to recursively search for the images in
pictureLocation="$HOME/Pictures/"
